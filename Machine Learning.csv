We're looking for an entrepreneurial candidate with strong analytical and communication skills to join the CEO's office at Squad.
This requires a candidate who is extremely motivated, dedicated, and passionate about entrepreneurship. It's a high growth opportunity to be part of fast-growing startup!

About Squad
Humans + AI = Future of Work
SquadVoice (http://squadvoice.co/?no_redirect): Traditional relationship-driven high-ticket consumer sales (like real estate) has zero intelligence and lacks sales acceleration tech. As a result, conversions are poor. We fix exactly that and enable teams to close 2-4x more deals on the same spend.
SquadVoice bridges the gap between marketing and sales by driving more qualified leads to sales-reps, increases ‘active pipeline', making reps more productive and accountable, thereby driving a 2-4x increase in deals. We're improving our funnel with every transaction that's going through the system as we're sitting on top of CRM data which no one's using.
After scaling this product in India, we launched SquadVoice in the US (https://www.squadvoice.co/?no_redirect), targeting the Real Estate industry, and are looking to scale this further. Here's the latest deck. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-WesMyGc7Ekr8AdrA7Ma7JTqZpylOGT/view)
It's an exciting time at Squad. 6 months into our launch in the US Real Estate market, we are really blowing up (growing 50%+ MoM)! As we venture into our next phase of growth, we are looking for passionate individuals to be a part of our journey and co-build Squad with us.

Overall Responsibilities
Working closely with various departments, increasingly in a consulting role, assisting line managers to understand and implement policies and procedures to scale the business.
Be the face of the company for talent acquisition and corporate communication activities across different channels.
Identify and execute Bizops initiatives to remove the growth bottlenecks for the company.
Help the CEO in navigating key challenges being faced by the firm across functions.
Investor Relations: Support CEO with investor communication and keeping them updated with the KPIs of the business
Requirements
1-3 years entrepreneurial experience (serious student startup experience counts).
Excellent written and oral communication skills and the ability to express thoughts logically and succinctly.
Sales, ownership and insane hustle.
Attention to detail.
Someone who is willing to learn and take challenges.
Education: Graduate in any domain (drop-outs are cool as well!)

We have an audacious vision of reimagining how work gets done! (https://twitter.com/shamiksharma/status/867671449871433729) We're one of the few applications of AI/ Machine Learning that actually has a massive market and business model to create a long term valuable business rather than a short-term acquisition play!
We have plans to grow 10x in the next 1.5 years.
We are a well-balanced team of experienced entrepreneurs and are backed by top investors across India and the Silicon Valley (Blume Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Emergent Ventures; Senior execs at Google, Square, Genpact & Flipkart; Co-founders of Infosys, Snapdeal, Slideshare, Zomato, etc)

Humans + AI = Future of Work
SquadVoice (http://squadvoice.co/?no_redirect): Traditional relationship-driven high-ticket consumer sales (like real estate) has zero intelligence and lacks sales acceleration tech. As a result, conversions are poor. We fix exactly that and enable teams to close 2-4x more deals in the same spend.
SquadVoice bridges the gap between marketing and sales by driving more qualified leads to sales-reps, increases ‘active pipeline', making reps more productive and accountable, thereby driving a 2-4x increase in deals.

Humans + AI = Future of Work
SquadVoice (http://squadvoice.co/?no_redirect): Traditional relationship-driven high-ticket consumer sales (like real estate) has zero intelligence and lacks sales acceleration tech. As a result, conversions are poor. We fix exactly that and enable teams to close 2-4x more deals in the same spend.
SquadVoice bridges the gap between marketing and sales by driving more qualified leads to sales-reps, increases ‘active pipeline', making reps more productive and accountable, thereby driving a 2-4x increase in deals. We're improving our funnel with every transaction that's going through the system as we're sitting on top of CRM data which no one's using.
After scaling this product in India, we launched SquadVoice in the US (https://www.squadvoice.co/?no_redirect), targeting the Real Estate industry, and are looking to scale this further. Here's the latest deck. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V-WesMyGc7Ekr8AdrA7Ma7JTqZpylOGT/view)
